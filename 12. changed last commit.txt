If you wanna change the last commit 
lets say u change index.html file
and you have written the command
    # git add index.html
    # git commit -m "change index 1"
    or 
    # git commit -am "change index 1"

and now when u type
    # git logs
note the sha value of the last commit

lets say what you have commited is wrong or you want to change it
for that what you can do is write 
    # git commit --amend -m "last message is changed to this one"
