lets say we have added a file and its in staging tree and we 
want that to roll back how will we do that?
for example we have a file index.html and i did some changes
now i want to add in a staging tree
        git add index.html
        .. this command will add the index.html in the staging tree

now we want to unstage it 
for what we have the command
        git reset head index.html
        .. with this command the index.html will be unstaged

we can say that its the opposite of the git add index.html
